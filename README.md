# BeCode Learner

## Introduction

> Hello, my name is Egide and l am an `aspiring junior developer` at BeCode. I was previously a bartender so if you are nice to me, l might make you a cocktail one of these days 😌.

## Three surprising skills l have

1. Solving the Rubik's cube in 15 seconds
2. I like to do Parkour from time to time
3. I dance in a rwandese group that organises a big show annually. This year it will take place at Louvain-la-neuve, so come see me dance 😉

## Three things that l like most in the universe.

1. My family
2. A nice cocktail after a long week. Preferably a **Moscow Mule**.
3. Traveling and discovering new places

`Nothing beats a Moscow mule after a long day of work`

## Objectives l want to achieve in my time here at BeCode

- Become job ready in **_7 months_**
- Create and deploy a webapp from A to Z
- Meet new developer friends 😏

## Some fears l have

- Looking back at things l have done and realizing l did not give it my all.
- Living an unexamined life (just drifting along)
- Being served cereals without any milk 🙀

## The things l'm most looking forward to

- Getting paid working as a developer
- Being part of a big project
- Being proficient in a valuable skill

## While working as a team, the things l value the most are ...

1. Having a common goal and splitting the work to accomplish it
2. Getting input from the other team members who might see things from a different angle
